										At Graphreach we were building a social media automation
										solution for content creators. I really enjoyed my stay
										there. My role exposed me much better to production
										environments where I got experience with monitoring and
										logging (Observability), containerization with docker and
										writing code using clean architecture.

									<p className="mt-2">
										Using React we built maintainable components with user
										accessibility in mind and wrote tests to make sure our
										components worked as expected.

									<p className="mt-2">
										In order to enforce a similar code convention and automate
										deployments to the cloud we worked with CI/CD pipelines that
										performed tasks from verifying if the code that is being
										pushed follows the company's code conventions to running
										tests to make sure nothing was broken during development and
										automating deployments to the cloud, handling database
										provisioning as well.

										At Copyup, we built a premium lms platform for copywriters
										to learn from industry experts. I enjoyed building this
										project as it gave me significant experience with working
										with user access control and insight into frontend
										architecture, video uploading and compression techniques,
										payment feature implementation and content management.

										I also got hands-on experience with visualization of data in
